// table does not list takes CLAUDE_STACK_DEFAULT_CONTEXT_WINDOW (seeded 1000000); with that unset or
// garbage, no window is known and the DEFAULT trigger applies. Nothing else decides - not a
// `[1m]`/`[200k]` id suffix, not the carry, not a compaction. Those inferences each fixed one case
// and broke another (Sonnet 5 runs 1M on a bare id, so the suffix read offered a resume at ~252k),
// and a window that moves with the session's own history cannot be predicted by the person who set
// it. The table holds the API maximum from the Claude models docs; a session that runs smaller than
// its row is the table's error, corrected in the table.
// The id is the main transcript's last `message.model` - subagents write their own files, so a
// Haiku helper cannot answer for the session - else the settings `model` when it is a full id.
// Measured: the PreToolUse payload carries no model and no window, and no env var names either.
