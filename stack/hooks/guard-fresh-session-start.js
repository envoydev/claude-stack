//   UserPromptSubmit        - the run arrives as a SLASH COMMAND, which emits NO Skill event at

//                             projects), at a moment a Stop may never come (measured: 23m27s /
//                             277 messages / +178k ctx, zero Stop events; and a conforming
//                             solve-task run emits zero Stops BY DESIGN). Injects, cannot block. The rule existed as
// prose in the generated capabilities rule and lost every time it was tested: measured across 4
// sessions, one of which NAMED the fresh-session need in its own text ('a fresh session is the
// right home for a loop like this') and then ran the loop anyway, to 380k tokens per message.
// Same step run fresh in the next session cost 134k. This is that rule mechanized.
//
// The incoming skill must be one of the orchestration entry points below - everything else passes -
