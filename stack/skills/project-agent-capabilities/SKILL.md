# Project Capabilities - inventory what is installed, generate the awareness rule

Every project trims the stack differently - skills commented out of the manifest, MCPs dropped (`sentry` where nothing monitors production, `angular-cli` outside Angular), seats it never installed. A predefined list would name capabilities the project does not have; this skill reads the REAL inventory and generates the rule from it, so every session knows exactly what this project can do - and never gets steered at a capability that is not there.

The measurements behind these rules live in `references/evidence.md` - an audit appendix, not a run-time load.

## The run - one script, one compose, one write

`scripts/capabilities-inventory.js` does every mechanical step in ONE node pass (built-ins only,
nothing to install, no per-skill fork): the precheck, the inventory with a printed COUNT per layer,
the live `claude mcp list`, the paste-ready MCP routing rows, the compare verdict and the
post-write verify. From the project root:

The script has TWO homes - copied under `.claude/skills/`, or carried by the plugin that ships this
skill, where the cache can hold several versions and the NEWEST is the one this skill came from - so
resolve it ONCE and reuse `$CAPS` for every call below. Run all of it from the project root:

```bash
CAPS=.claude/skills/project-agent-capabilities/scripts/capabilities-inventory.js
[ -f "$CAPS" ] || CAPS=$(for d in "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}"/plugins/cache/*/claude-stack/*; do
  f="$d/stack/skills/project-agent-capabilities/scripts/capabilities-inventory.js"
  [ -f "$f" ] && printf '%s\t%s\n' "$(basename "$d")" "$f"
done 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1 | cut -f2)
node "$CAPS"
```

An empty `$CAPS` means neither home has it: say so and stop, never hand-tally the inventory instead.

**Its printed block is the whole inventory.** Re-grepping, re-Reading or hand-tallying anything it
printed is a defect, not diligence - every count and every row of the report comes off one of its
lines, and a claim with no printed line behind it does not go in the report. It probes the `claude`
CLI without laundering a failure into an empty result (`<cmd> || echo none`, banned in
`baseline-navigation.md:41`) and without `| head -N`, so `CLI absent` and `0 plugins` stay
different report fields.

### 1. PRECHECK - the script's first lines
- `PRECHECK: FIRST` - no rule yet. Compose and write; this is the capture the skill exists for.
- `PRECHECK: empty` - nothing under the inventory sources changed since the rule was written. Say
  so in ONE line naming the `Captured:` date that line quotes, and STOP. Do not compose, do not
  write. Two things the precheck cannot see, and the only two reasons to go on: the PLUGIN list is
  machine-global (an enable or disable changes no file in this tree), and the USER may ask for a
  refresh outright. Either overrides it - say which one you are acting on.
- `PRECHECK: drift - <n> file(s)` - that is the drift. Continue, and name those paths in the report.

### 2. COMPOSE the body - the verdict authorizes the write
Read `references/generated-rule-template.md` for the four sections' fill rules, then compose the
WHOLE body in-session: the block below verbatim, with only its `<...>` slots filled from the
script's lines. One slot is not a slot - every `<docs-path>` becomes the LITERAL `DOCS ROOT` value
the script printed, because the generated rule is a deterministic pointer and cannot itself carry
the placeholder it exists to resolve.

Write the composed body to a scratch file, then run the verdict:

```bash
node "$CAPS" --body <that file>
```

- `COMPARE: identical` - do NOT write. Report `rule unchanged - <N> bytes, not rewritten`, and go
  to step 3's report. An identical rewrite pays a delete plus a full write, and the next session
  pays the changed mtime.
- `COMPARE: differs` - write the composed body over the rule in ONE call, the whole file. No
  in-place Edit, no `sed -i`, no partial upsert: an edit keeps stale policy wording the skill has
  since changed. Do NOT `rm` it first - the auto-mode classifier denies that delete, which costs
  exactly the blocked round trip the delete was meant to save.

Without a printed `COMPARE: differs` line there is nothing to write.

The block below is a COPY TARGET, not prose to retype:

# This project's capabilities

Captured: <the script's CAPTURED line>

## Usage policy (fixed - stamped verbatim, every run)
<!-- policy-rev: a50faffe -->
- Load a skill for the work at hand - a file you're about to edit, a command you're about
  to run, a diff you're about to show - never to answer a question. Over-loading a simple
  turn is the failure to avoid.
- One home per rule: route in the project's CLAUDE.md only what an auto-injected
  description does not already cover. Path-scoped rules own per-file-type routing; hooks
  own deterministic gates and announce their own blocks - add a new gate as a hook, not prose.
- Subagent dispatch is explicit, never automatic: a user @agent-<name> mention, an
  orchestration skill routing to it, or a path-scoped repair-loop rule naming its resolver.
  Never self-delegate off a description match. When a task calls for multi-agent work,
  suggest the matching orchestration skill from the inventory below - never one this
  project does not carry.
- Memory recall is historical, not current: this stack switches the assistant's own
  per-project auto-memory OFF once its existing notes are imported into the shared
  `memory` MCP - so anything it recalls is frozen at that import, and anything since
  lives in the `memory` MCP instead (`baseline-memory.md` says when to search it).
  Validate any seat, skill, or command an OLD recalled memory names against this rule's
  inventory before acting on it - a recall can name a capability this project no longer
  carries.
- A slash-only skill or plugin command (`disable-model-invocation` - the ones listed
  below) is the USER's to type - never call it yourself. Do not rely on the harness to
  stop you: `guard-fresh-session-start.js` denies that call now, and the rule holds with or
  without it. Never attempt one, never retry it under another spelling, and never spend
  the turn explaining that you cannot or weighing whether to: name the command, say in one
  line what it will do, hand the turn back.
- A deliberate orchestration skill (a capture, a quality loop, a build flow) starts in a
  fresh session when this one already carries another skill run's history. This is
  MECHANIZED, not advice: `guard-fresh-session-start.js` blocks the Skill call past the
  per-window trigger (150,000 tokens on a 200k window, 400,000 on a 1M one, 180,000 on any other
  window and on one that cannot be read at all) and the block is answered
  with one AskUserQuestion (fresh session, recommended, ending the turn with the resume
  block - or continue here with the cost stated). Do not restate the rule as a reminder to
  'name the route' - the prose form of it does not hold.
- Every doc the assistant creates lands under the docs root (`<docs-path>`), in its owned
  folder: `architecture/`, `test-coverage/`, `loops/` - and `related-projects/` for the
  sibling-repo orientation doc (`related-projects/RELATED-PROJECTS.md`), with the plain folder
  `related-context/` alongside it for every OTHER sibling-repo doc (cross-repo plans, change
  requests, issue notes, run recipes; look there before re-deriving sibling state). A doc outside
  the root takes the user's approval, asked first - never silently.

## Orchestration skills (slash-only - invisible until invoked)
<the script's `/name - clause` rows, one per row>

## Subagent seats
<the script's SEATS name line - each seat under the name that RESOLVES: a seat from a plugin is
addressable only as `<plugin>:<seat>`, and a bare name returns 'Agent type not found'>

## MCP routing
<the script's `MCP ROUTING rows` block, pasted verbatim>

## Plugins
<the script's PLUGINS name line; omit the section when it printed `CLI absent`>
```

The usage-policy section is the house skill/agent policy's ONE home - it ships verbatim from this skill (a policy wording change lands here and reaches projects on their next re-run). Copy the `<!-- policy-rev: ... -->` line with it, unchanged: it is a content stamp over the block, recomputed by the stack's own lint whenever the policy text moves, and it is the ONLY way to tell a project carrying a current copy from one carrying a two-release-old one. `/claude-stack:validate` compares a project's stamp against the snapshot's. Like every generated `baseline-project-*.md` rule it stays out of the installer's fetch manifest, so a stack update cannot overwrite it.

This skill was renamed from project-capabilities: when a legacy `.claude/rules/baseline-project-capabilities.md` exists, delete it in the same run - this rule supersedes it, and nothing else ever prunes generated rules.

### 3. VERIFY - after the write, before the report

```bash
node "$CAPS" --verify .claude/rules/baseline-project-agent-capabilities.md
```

It parses the frontmatter with node - never PyYAML, which is missing on machines where a run died
on ModuleNotFoundError and still reported 'frontmatter parses' off a weaker check - and checks
there is no `paths:` key, that the `<!-- policy-rev: ... -->` stamp and the policy block came over verbatim, that
the inventory headings are present, and that every MCP row carries its `first call:` line. A
non-zero exit means the rule is not done: fix and re-run it. Its `VERIFY:` line is a report field.

### 4. REPORT
A literal line template, not prose to remember - every field is one of the script's printed lines:

```
Rule:       <created | refreshed | unchanged, not rewritten> - <N> bytes   (the COMPARE line)
Verify:     <the VERIFY: line, or `not run - nothing written`>
Inventory:  skills <n> / seats <n> / rules <n> / MCP <n> / plugins <n | CLI absent>
Drift:      <the paths PRECHECK printed, or `user asked for a refresh` / `plugin state only`>
Live from:  next session - an always-on rule is read at session start, so it does not govern this one
Flags:      <one row each, or `none`>
```

Then the prose, short - four things, each its own line so none of them is skimmed past:

- **Say `Live from:` the one way it is true on BOTH branches** - an always-on rule loads at session start, not retroactively, so this one governs from the next session and its guidance starts applying at the next `/clear`. It is UNCONDITIONAL and identical whether or not anything was written, and there is no next-run line: a capture is suggested only where its output is stale.
- **The flags are MECHANICAL - read them off the block, do not eyeball them**: the script's `heavy native deps registered:` line is one row per hit; its `seat families` line against its path-scoped rule rows is the convention-rule cross-check (a family whose stack no rule names); and a slash-only skill whose seats are not installed is a third.
- **Never infer causation from a machine-global listing** - state observed facts plainly ('typescript-lsp: listed disabled'), and never assert WHY something is installed or disabled: `claude plugin list` is machine-global, so install-scope causation read off it is a guess.
- **Say that the rule is MACHINE-LOCAL, not committed** - the installers tell every project to gitignore `.claude/*` and re-include only `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, so this file is untracked, a fresh clone does not carry it, and the command has to be re-run there.

## Don't game it
The rule lists what the inventory proved, nothing else - no capability assumed from the house defaults, no row for a server or skill the project dropped, and an unreadable source reported as unreadable (the script prints it that way) rather than filled from memory.

A thin `.claude/skills` is not by itself a broken install: when the layers come from plugins the script prints `SOURCE: PLUGIN-COVERED` and reports the UNION - what those plugins carry plus whatever is copied locally, which on that route is only the items no plugin holds. Stop and say so only when it printed neither a local nor a plugin source.
