# claude-stack plugin evals

`claude plugin eval` runs these cases against the plugin and again WITHOUT it, and reports the
delta. Every run is a real, billed model call on your own account.

## Why this suite exists at all

The standing excuse for not evaluating this plugin was that nothing in it is model-invocable: all
six commands and the router skill carry `disable-model-invocation`. That excuse is wrong. A case's
`prompt.md` is a USER turn, which is exactly how a manual-only command is invoked, so a read-only
walk makes a valid case - and its without-arm cannot resolve the command at all, which is the
cleanest delta a suite can produce.

The two setup cases are READ-ONLY by construction: neither grants `Bash`, `Write` or `Edit`, so no run can
install anything, and both fire in the run's empty sandbox working directory where there is no
install to change.

## The cases

| case | prompt | what it proves |
|---|---|---|
| `status-no-install` | `/claude-stack:status` | with nothing installed, the command says so and routes to `/claude-stack:init` instead of rendering its fixed table shapes from the command body |
| `router-hands-back-one-command` | `/claude-stack` | the router reads the state, names ONE command, and does not start the walk itself |
| `size-first-trivial` | `/project-solve-task fix the typo in the README title` | a one-file typo is sized trivial: a size line first, the edit, no design step, no stop |
| `size-first-small` | `/project-solve-task the date pipe shows UTC in two components, fix it` | a two-file fix is sized small: no design step, one stop at most, both components fixed |
| `size-first-floor` | `/project-solve-task add a password reset endpoint` | the floor holds - an auth task on a one-file API is standard and starts at the design step |

The three `size-first-*` cases grade the `## Size first` section of `project-solve-task`. They are the
only cases that write (`Edit` is granted, the floor case excepted), each into its own scaffolded
workspace - `scaffold.sh` beside `case.yaml`, run only under `--scaffold`. The small row's verifier seat
ships in a per-stack plugin, never in the core, so no case grades it.

## Last recorded run

2026-09-12, Claude Code 2.1.269, default model, `--judge-model claude-haiku-4-5`, 3 runs per arm.

| case | with | without | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| `router-hands-back-one-command` | 1.00 | 0.00 | +1.00 |
| `status-no-install` | 1.00 | 0.33 | +0.67 |

Mean delta +0.83 over 12 runs, 112s, $0.84. The without-arm's one passing grader is
`no-invented-tables`, which a session with no plugin passes for free - it has no tables to invent.
Re-record this table whenever a command body changes; a delta that falls is the command losing its
own contract, and a `with` score under 1.00 is the command failing it outright.

## Running it

```bash
claude plugin eval setup-plugin --case '[rs][ot]*' --max-cost-usd 3 --judge-model claude-haiku-4-5   # router + status
claude plugin eval setup-plugin --case status-no-install --runs 1 --ablation none   # iterate cheaply
claude plugin eval claude-stack@claude-stack --eval-dir setup-plugin/evals --case 'size-first-*' --scaffold --max-cost-usd 5
```

The `size-first-*` cases need the CORE plugin as the target, because `setup-plugin/` alone does not
carry `project-solve-task`. That target resolves the INSTALLED release; to grade a working tree, add
it as the marketplace first (`claude plugin marketplace add <repo>`) in a throwaway config dir.

Two things measured on 2.1.269 that the docs page does not spell out, so do not re-derive them: a
`regex` grader's `target` accepts `last_message` (the default) and `files`, and a plain string like
`final_message` fails case validation with `graders.N.target: Invalid input`; and `--max-cost-usd`
is checked BEFORE each run launches, so a ceiling below one run's cost still pays for the first one.

`results/` is gitignored - the artifact is machine-local and re-dated every run. The table above is
the part worth keeping.
