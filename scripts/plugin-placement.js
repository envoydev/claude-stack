// Where every skill and agent lives. Placement is COMPUTED from meta/recommendations.json +
// meta/stack-graph.json, never hand-written, so `stack/` stays the one home per piece and a new skill
// lands by the same rule as every other.
//
// The rule, whole:
//   1. Close the ALWAYS selection. Everything in it is the CORE plugin, enabled in every install.
//   2. Everything else is LIBRARY: shipped in this repo, listed by no marketplace entry, copied into
//      a project per pick by the installer.
//
// Why not a plugin per stack (the 1.0 rule, owner sets named in GROUP_NAMES): a plugin skill is
// LOCKED on. Claude Code resolves a plugin skill's `skillOverrides` value to 'on' before any
// setting is read, and a `Skill(...)` deny removes nothing from the listing - both measured in the
// 2026-09-24 library test on 2.1.281. So a skill that rode a per-stack plugin could never be
// switched off in the one project that did not want it; a project COPY can - deleted, or set to
// 'off' / 'name-only' in `skillOverrides`, or hidden by a `paths:` line until a matching file is
// touched. The per-stack entries v1.2.0 shipped are frozen in meta/retired-entries.json for their
// one release of transition.
