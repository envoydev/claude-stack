// E of the 154-bundle audit. Every case here was REPLAYED live on the shipped hook before the fix,
// so each pins a real regression - a false positive that blocked honest work and taught the model a
// bypass, or a remedy that could not be run. Both directions carry equal weight: the shape that was
// wrongly blocked passes now, and the dump or the out-of-tree write the gate exists for still blocks.
