//        registry during a build and never at launch. `node scripts/refresh-mcp-pins.js --write`
//        moves a pin; a null version ships unpinned, the same fallback the installer had.
//
// Per-project values cannot come from the project settings.json: a plugin MCP entry expands only
// the SHELL and the ACCOUNT settings env (measured 2026-09-22 - S10's note to the contrary is
// retracted in docs/plugin-migration-evidence.md). What a plugin server DOES get is a cwd equal to
