// THE INSTALL STAMP - the revision every artifact of this install was copied from.
//
// `/claude-stack:configure` diffs it against `main` to say what an update would bring, and
// `--installed-only` reads two of its lines to tell a DROPPED item from one that did not exist yet.
// That second job is why the stamp records more than a SHA.
//
// The rule that matters most: NO SHA MEANS NO STAMP. When no source resolved this run - the archive
// download and the clone both failed, and every step fail-softly kept its existing copy - stamping
// would claim an install that did not happen. A wrong stamp is worse than none, because the next
// configure reads it as truth and reports the wrong diff, so a previous stamp is left untouched.
//
// `shipped-hooks` is the hook FILE names this RELEASE ships - the catalog, one entry per file and
// not per matcher, never this run's subset. On disk a hook the user dropped through configure and a
// hook that did not exist when this install was made look identical; only the second may be
// adopted, and this line is the only thing that can tell them apart.
//
// `picked-skills` / `picked-agents` are the skills and seats this run installed. The next
// `--installed-only` reads the plugin state back through THAT release's placement, so an item a
// release moved into an entry this project has not enabled would drop out; these two lines carry it
// across (derive-state's `stampCarried`, which honours a parked entry and a denied seat).
//
// `installed-always-rules` / `installed-always-mcps` record what the locked baseline actually
// CARRIES as the run ends, never what shipped. A server counts either way - registered in the file,
// or riding the plugin named for it - because on the plugin route there is no `.mcp.json` at all,
// and a stamp that only read the file would record an install with none of the locked three.
