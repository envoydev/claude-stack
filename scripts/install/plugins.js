// THE PLUGIN LAYER - what this run enables, at which scope, and what it takes back out.
//
// From Phase 3 onward the plugins ARE the delivery: the skills, agents, hooks and (Phase 6) MCP
// servers all arrive through the project's own closure, and the copy route is the escape hatch.
// So the decisions here are the install.
//
// Five rules, each one measured:
//
//   - THE CLOSURE IS COMPUTED ONCE, by `selection-plugins.js`, and it is fed skill/agent lines only
//     when the skills route is on and mcp lines only when the MCP route is. Whatever comes back is
//     exactly what this combination of routes needs enabled.
//   - A FAILURE TO COMPUTE IT DROPS BOTH ROUTES TO COPY, together and loudly. Half a closure would
//     leave a project with neither the plugin's copy of an item nor its own.
//   - `claude plugin update` IS A NO-OP ON A PLUGIN THAT IS NOT INSTALLED, and says nothing about
//     one that is installed but DISABLED. So update must install an absent plugin and enable a
//     parked one BEFORE it updates - measured: two added plugins still `disabled` after a run,
//     recovered by hand over eight messages and ~1.05M of context.
//   - THE PLUGIN'S OWN SCOPE WINS on update, read from the listing: `claude plugin update --scope
//     <other>` is a silent no-op, so passing the INSTALL's scope left every user-scoped plugin on
//     its old version under a project install.
//   - VERSIONS ARE READ BACK. `claude plugin update` reports success whether or not anything moved.
