// THE SETTINGS.JSON WRITER - the env block, the hook wirings, the secret deny-list and the MCP
// pre-approval list, all of it idempotent because it runs on install AND update.
//
// The rule that governs everything here: A SETTINGS.JSON THAT DOES NOT PARSE IS LEFT UNTOUCHED.
// Falling back to `{}` would REPLACE the project's whole file - their permissions, their statusLine,
// their env - with just the stack's entries. A run that cannot read the file changes nothing and
// says so.
//
// The env pass has a fixed ORDER, and the order is load-bearing:
//   1. RENAMES first - carry the user's VALUE to the new key, then drop the old one. Seeding first
//      would write a default over a value the user had set under the old name.
//   2. RETIREMENTS - a key nothing reads any more is DROPPED, never carried, because a dead key in
//      the env block reads like a knob that still works. One that still means something outside
//      this stack goes only when its value is still exactly the seed it was given.
//   3. BAD SEEDS - a key whose shipped default turned out wrong is corrected only while it still
//      holds that default. A value the user set by hand is theirs.
//   4. SEEDS - absent-only, from meta/environment.json, so the catalog is the one list.
//   5. WRITTEN keys - the two that track a choice THIS run just made (the memory db path, the
//      sentry auth mode). A level change or an auth switch has to land, or the plugin launcher and
//      the headers helper keep reading the old one.
//
// Two keys are not catalog-simple. CLAUDE_STACK_DOCS_VERSIONING is a DECISION with a four-home
// seeding rule, so the caller resolves it and hands the answer in. CLAUDE_STACK_HOOKS_OFF is the
// one exception to absent-only: when a walk answered the hooks layer THIS run, that answer wins,
// because the user is looking at the question as it is asked.
