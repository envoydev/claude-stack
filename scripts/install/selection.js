// THE SELECTION - which of the six manifest lists this run actually installs.
//
// Two ways in, and they meet in the same filter:
//
//   - `--selection <file>`: one `category name` per line, from a guided walk. The filter INTERSECTS
//     with the manifest, so a name the manifest does not carry can never be installed - which is
//     what makes a user-authored skill or rule safe by construction.
//   - `--installed-only`: derive that file from what the target already carries, then refresh
//     exactly that. The update fast path.
//
// Three rules that are each a bug that shipped:
//
//   - A SELECTION WITH NO `hook` LINES INSTALLS EVERY HOOK. Hooks joined the walk later, so a file
//     written before that layer must keep its install-everything behaviour. `--installed-only`
//     answers this by emptying the hook list itself when the disk carries none.
//   - A HOOK THIS RELEASE ADDED REACHES AN EXISTING INSTALL ONLY HERE, so hooks are all-or-nothing
//     on the derived path: an install that HAS hooks gets every shipped one. The exception is a
//     DELIBERATE DROP - a hook named in the previous stamp and absent now was removed through
//     configure and stays removed.
//   - THE ALWAYS-ON BASELINE IS ADOPTED THE SAME WAY, with NO drop exception: the always set is
//     locked, so an always item absent from disk is adopted whatever the stamp says. A stamp naming
//     the shipped list once read as a drop of everything, and the memory rule never arrived.
