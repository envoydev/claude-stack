// THE COPY LAYER - what a run still puts into the project itself.
//
// After Phases 3, 5 and 6 that is a short list: the rules, the skills and agents NO plugin carries
// (the extras), and the two hook ENGINES plus the model-window table. Everything else arrives
// through the project's own plugin closure.
//
// Four rules, all of them the shell's, and each one is a bug that happened:
//
//   - IDENTICAL CONTENT IS NOT REWRITTEN. An update that rewrites every file makes every file look
//     changed to git, and a project that commits its docs would see a diff per release.
//   - AN IDENTICAL FILE THAT LOST ITS EXEC BIT GETS IT BACK. A re-clone, or a checkout that dropped
//     the mode, leaves a hook that cannot run - and because the content matches, the copy that
//     would have fixed it is skipped. So the bit is re-asserted on the skip path too.
//   - A MISSING SOURCE FILE IS REPORTED AND SKIPPED. One bad file must not take the other 116 down,
//     and the copy already in the project stays: a source that could not be read is a reason to
//     change nothing, never a reason to delete.
//   - THE DESTINATION DIRECTORY IS MADE ON THE WAY, including for a nested path.
