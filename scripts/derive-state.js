//   node scripts/derive-state.js --floor --plugins <enabled entries, csv> [--settings <file>]
//
// Before this script, four readers answered the same question in their own words: the three guided
// walks described what the install would write, and the seed computed it again in code. That is how
// a route change reaches three of them and not the fourth. Every one of them now runs this and
// REPORTS its output, so a disagreement is a diff of one JSON object rather than an argument
// between two prose paragraphs.
//
// It owns no engine of its own. The closure is `stack-select.js`, the placement is
// `selection-plugins.js`, and this script is the third thing they never covered: what the project
// carries that it did NOT pick, and what can be switched off about it.
//
// Three rules, one per surface, each measured:
//
//   - AGENTS have a real lever. Spike S3: `permissions.deny: ["Agent(<plugin>:<name>)"]` drops the
//     seat from the listing and its description from the bill, -434 tokens for one seat. With 43
//     seats shipped that is the largest trim left. The scoped identifier is the measured address;
//     the docs give the general form as `Agent(AgentName)` ('Agent (subagents)',
//     code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions), which is the spelling for a project-local seat. It is written only for a seat an ENABLED plugin
//     carries: a seat in a plugin this project never enabled is not loaded at all, so denying it is
//     noise now and a trap later - the day that plugin is enabled, the stale entry silently drops a
//     seat the user just asked for.
//   - SKILLS have none. Spike S2: `skillOverrides` moved 0 tokens on a plugin skill under either
//     the bare or the scoped key. So a skill the closure carries and the selection did not pick is
//     REPORTED as undroppable, and there is deliberately no `off` key to mistake for a lever.
//   - HOOKS are switched off by NAME, against the whole shipped catalog, because the hooks plugin
//     carries all thirteen whatever the project picked (`CLAUDE_STACK_HOOKS_OFF`, Phase 2).
